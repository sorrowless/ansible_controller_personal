# It sets become pass, vault file, mitogen path. Beware that it uses env vars
# and plain textfiles in /tmp/, so do not use it if you have insecure
# environment then you should not use it as env vars can be read by another
# user in some circumstances.
#
# How to use it: go to to controller repository source and run
# > . ./tools/set-vars.sh
#
# then fill asked fields and that's it.
