# This is a playbook to install full-fledged monitoring solution based on
# Sensu. This playbook manages both Sensu master node and slave nodes which
# should be monitored. Installation itself includes:
# - Graphite DB to store metrics perstistently
# - Grafana dashboard to show stored metrics
# - Sensu master to collect all the metrics from nodes
# - Sensu agent to be configured on slave nodes which should be monitored
# - Uchiwa dashboard for looking at alerts happening in real-time
# - Nginx to proxy to Uchiwa dashboard
# - TLS role to ensure https connection to Uchiwa dashboard
#
# Run it like usual executable script:
#
# > ./run-monitoring.yml
#
# For configuration vars look at roles variables or host_vars/.example
# directory.
